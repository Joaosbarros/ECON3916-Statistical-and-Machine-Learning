# 👋 Hi, I'm Joao

### Economics Student | Aspiring Data Scientist | Bridging Theory and Practice

I'm an undergraduate economics student passionate about combining rigorous economic theory with modern data science methodologies. I'm actively seeking opportunities in **economic research, data analysis, and applied econometrics** where I can contribute to evidence-based decision-making.

## 🎓 What I'm Learning

I'm currently developing skills that unite:
- **Causal Inference** – Understanding *why* things happen through economic theory
- **Predictive Analytics** – Forecasting *what* will happen using machine learning
- **Statistical Rigor** – Ensuring conclusions are both accurate and meaningful

## 📂 Featured Repository

### [ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics](link-to-your-course-repo)

This repository showcases my coursework using a **"Concept Extension"** approach—taking foundational statistical concepts (like OLS regression) and scaling them up with ML algorithms (like Lasso and Ridge regression).

**What's inside:**
- Labs applying statistical learning to economic problems
- Projects demonstrating the progression from classical methods to modern ML techniques
- Real-world economic data analysis combining explanatory and predictive modeling
