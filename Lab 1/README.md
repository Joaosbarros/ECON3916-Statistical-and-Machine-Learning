# 🍔 Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis via the Big Mac Index

## Objective

This project applies "Burgernomics"—The Economist's playful yet insightful methodology—to empirically test the **Law of One Price** and assess currency valuation across international markets using the Big Mac as a standardized commodity basket.

## Methodology

- **Data Construction**: Built a structured dataset from The Economist's 2015 Big Mac Index using Python dictionaries, capturing local Big Mac prices and official exchange rates across multiple economies
- **PPP Calculation**: Computed implied Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates by comparing the cost of an identical good (Big Mac) across currencies
- **Valuation Analysis**: Quantified currency misalignment by measuring the percentage deviation between market exchange rates and PPP-implied rates, identifying potential overvaluation and undervaluation
- **Tools**: Leveraged Python and Pandas for data manipulation, transformation, and comparative analysis

## Key Findings

[**Template for your results - replace with your actual findings:**]

The analysis revealed significant deviations from purchasing power parity across the sample currencies. The Norwegian Krone emerged as substantially overvalued relative to the US Dollar (approximately X% above PPP), suggesting either higher domestic costs, trade barriers, or market frictions. Conversely, emerging market currencies such as [currency name] demonstrated undervaluation of Y%, potentially indicating arbitrage opportunities or structural differences in local market conditions. These findings align with the broader economic principle that the Law of One Price holds imperfectly in the short run due to transaction costs, non-tradable inputs (labor, rent), and varying tax regimes across jurisdictions.

## Economic Implications

This exercise demonstrates that while absolute PPP rarely holds precisely due to market imperfections, the Big Mac Index serves as a useful heuristic for identifying currencies that may be fundamentally misaligned—information valuable for international investors, policymakers, and economists analyzing real exchange rate dynamics.
